<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'll put the information for the tabling event and the game event here, and put this as the link in QR codes.  For the tabling event we can include more information on the organization &lpar;the ratios from our class assignment for example&rpar; and for the game event we can include a Google form to RSVP or pre-register. </p>
